    "text": "I am an undergrad studying Data Science at IIT Madras with a keen interest in the realms of machine learning, data science, econometrics and quantitative finance. I like to learn new things, seeking knowledge in domains besides tech as well whenever time and circumstances allow me. In leisure, I like to spend time with my wonderful family and friends. There’s nothing quite like sharing laughter and creating memories together.\nI am also fond of physics, deep conversation might lead to question my majors. Other things I like to talk about range to history and philosophy however I haven’t explored as many texts as I aspired to. I desire to travel to many parts of the world, soaking myself in different cultures and create unforgettable memories. Music and chess are the others things that I like a lot, not much of a professional, I play chess for fun."
