You’ll be able to pan and zoom with the charts created with plotly and bokeh!\nSo, now lets head on to fetch our data first."

    "section": "Plots",
    "text": "Plots\nNow we will head straight into plotting. We will start with mplfinance, a special module for finance charts of matplotlib.\n\nmplfinance\nCreating candlestick charts with mplfinance is a simple one line code:\n\n\nCode\nimport mplfinance as mpf\n\nmpf.plot(data, type=\"candle\", volume=True, style=\"yahoo\",\n         figsize=(6,3),title=\"AAPL Candlestick with Mplfinance\",\n        ylabel=\"Price [USD]\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot uses the “yahoo” style. We can check the available style using the command mpf.available_styles(). Now let us look at a few other available styles below:\n\n\nCode\nmc_list = [\"binance\",\"blueskies\",\"starsandstripes\",\"brasil\"]\n\nfig = mpf.figure(figsize=(6,6))\nax_dict = {}\n\nfor i,st in enumerate(mc_list):\n    ax_dict[i]=fig.add_subplot(2,2,i+1, style=st)\n    mpf.plot(data[:50], type =\"candle\", ax=ax_dict[i], axtitle=(st),xrotation=0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we will tweak and play with the candle colors and background. First we will set the base mplstyle to dark_background (for reference, check here). Then we will set marketcolors for the chart:\n\n\nCode\nmc = mpf.make_marketcolors(up=\"g\",down=\"r\",inherit=True)\ns = mpf.make_mpf_style(base_mpl_style=\"dark_background\",marketcolors=mc)\nmpf.plot(data, type=\"candle\", volume=True, style=s,\n         figsize=(6,3),title=\"Customised Dark theme plot on mplfinance\",\n        ylabel=\"Price [USD]\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor looking further stye changes using mplfinance, one might check their example notebook\nWe will move ahead and try hands on some interactive plotting libraries.\n\n\nPlotly\nPlotly is perhaps the most used interactive visualization library in python. It offers a great deal of customization. With Plotly, we will make two types of charts, OHLC and Volume plotted together in first one, separate in the next.\n\n\nCode\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\n\nfig = make_subplots(specs=[[{\"secondary_y\": True}]])\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Candlestick(x=data.index, open=data[\"Open\"],\n                              high=data[\"High\"], low=data[\"Low\"],\n                             close=data[\"Close\"], name = \"OHLC\"), secondary_y=False)\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=data.index, y=data['Volume'], opacity=0.3,\n                     name= \"Volume\"), secondary_y=True)\n\nfig.update_layout(title=\"AAPL Candlestick with Plotly\", width=900, height=400)\nfig.update_yaxes(title=\"Price [USD]\", secondary_y=False, showgrid=True)\nfig.update_yaxes(title=\"Volume\", secondary_y=True, showgrid=False)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nIn the next one, we hide the range slider for better viewing and separate the volume bar chart:\n\n\nCode\nfig = make_subplots(rows=2, cols=1, shared_xaxes=True, vertical_spacing=0.05, row_width=[0.2, 0.7])\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Candlestick(x=data.index, open=data[\"Open\"],\n                              high=data[\"High\"], low=data[\"Low\"],\n                             close=data[\"Close\"], name = \"OHLC\"), row=1, col=1)\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=data.index, y=data['Volume'], opacity=0.3,\n                     name= \"Volume\"), row=2, col=1)\n\nfig.update_layout(title=\"AAPL Candlestick with Plotly\", width=900, height=500)\n\nfig.update(layout_xaxis_rangeslider_visible=False)\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\nPlotly as well offers multiple themes and customizations, for now will use the dark theme and just change the colors of volume bars for the first plot.\n\n\nCode\nfig = make_subplots(specs=[[{\"secondary_y\": True}]])\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Candlestick(x=data.index, open=data[\"Open\"],\n                              high=data[\"High\"], low=data[\"Low\"],\n                             close=data[\"Close\"], name = \"OHLC\"), secondary_y=False)\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=data.index, y=data['Volume'], opacity=0.3,\n                     name= \"Volume\", marker_color=\"gray\"), secondary_y=True)\n\nfig.update_layout(title=\"AAPL Candlestick with Plotly\", width=900, height=500, xaxis={\"rangeslider\":{\"visible\":False}}, template=\"plotly_dark\")\nfig.update_yaxes(title=\"Price [USD]\", secondary_y=False, showgrid=True)\nfig.update_yaxes(title=\"Volume\", secondary_y=True, showgrid=False)\n\nfig.show()\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nBokeh plot\nQuoting:\n\nBokeh is an interactive visualization library for modern web browsers. It provides elegant, concise construction of versatile graphics, and affords high-performance interactivity over large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily make interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.\n\nBokeh additionally has great documentation and user guide. Now let’s look at a candlestick chart created using Bokeh:\n\n\nCode\nfrom bokeh.layouts import column\nfrom bokeh.plotting import figure, show, output_notebook\nfrom bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource, RangeTool, BoxAnnotation, HoverTool\nfrom bokeh.resources import INLINE\n\n\noutput_notebook(resources=INLINE)\n\ninc= data.Close &gt; data.Open\ndec = data.Open &gt; data.Close\nTOOLS = \"pan,wheel_zoom,box_zoom,reset,save\"\nwidth_set = pd.Timedelta(\"16H\")\n\n\nfig = figure(x_axis_type=\"datetime\", tools=TOOLS, width=900, height=350,\n             title=\"AAPL Candlestick with Bokeh\")\n\nfig.segment(data.index, data.High, data.index, data.Low, color=\"black\")\nfig.vbar(data.index[dec], width_set, data.Open[dec], data.Close[dec], color=\"red\")\nfig.vbar(data.index[inc], width_set, data.Open[inc], data.Close[inc], color=\"green\")\nfig.yaxis.axis_label=\"Price [USD]\"\n\nvol = figure(x_axis_type=\"datetime\", tools=TOOLS, width=900, height=150, x_range=fig.x_range)\nvol.vbar(data.index, width=width_set, top=data.Volume, fill_color=\"grey\", alpha=0.5)\nvol.yaxis.axis_label=\"Volume\"\n\nshow(column(fig,vol))\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n        Loading BokehJS ...\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nGreat! We will now change to dark theme. Check out : bokeh themes.\n\n\nCode\nfrom bokeh.plotting import curdoc\nfrom bokeh.themes import Theme\noutput_notebook(resources=INLINE)\n\ninc= data.Close &gt; data.Open\ndec = data.Open &gt; data.Close\nTOOLS = \"pan,wheel_zoom,box_zoom,reset,save\"\nwidth_set = pd.Timedelta(\"16H\")\n\n\nfig = figure(x_axis_type=\"datetime\", tools=TOOLS, width=900, height=400,\n             title=\"AAPL Candlestick with Bokeh\")\n\nfig.segment(data.index, data.High, data.index, data.Low, color=\"white\")\nfig.vbar(data.index[dec], width_set, data.Open[dec], data.Close[dec], color=\"red\")\nfig.vbar(data.index[inc], width_set, data.Open[inc], data.Close[inc], color=\"green\")\nfig.yaxis.axis_label=\"Price [USD]\"\n\ndoc = curdoc()\ndoc.theme = \"dark_minimal\"\ndoc.add_root(fig)\nshow(fig)\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n        Loading BokehJS ...\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThat really looks good. If you are going through the code here, you can see how simple it would be to change the colors of bars. One can further add tooltips that will display the OHLC data on hovering over the candles.\nOne might further look at libraries like Altair, ggplot. One great library that I just found while writing this post is Holoviews\nHave fun plotting!"
