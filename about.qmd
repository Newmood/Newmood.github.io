I am an undergrad student with a keen interest in the realms of machine learning, data science, econometrics and quantitative finance.  I like to learn new things, seeking knowledge in domains besides tech as well whenever time and circumstances allow me. I also enjoy teaching and sharing my newfound knowledge by writing handouts.

In leisure, I like to spend time with my wonderful family and friends. There's nothing quite like sharing laughter and creating memories together. 

## Education
