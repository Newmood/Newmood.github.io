I am an undergrad studying Data Science at IIT Madras with a keen interest in the realms of machine learning, data science, econometrics and quantitative finance.  I like to learn new things, seeking knowledge in domains besides tech as well whenever time and circumstances allow me.

I am also fond of physics, deep conversation might lead to question my majors. Other things I like to talk about range to history and philosophy however I haven't explored as many texts as I aspired to. I desire to travel to many parts of the world, soaking myself in different cultures and create unforgettable memories. Listening to music and chess are sort of a hobby that I like a lot, not much of a professional, I just play chess for fun. In leisure, I like to spend time with my wonderful family and friends. There's nothing quite like sharing laughter and creating memories together. Sharing stories with friends while exploring new eateries or going to that "great spot" that your friend knows is indeed cherishable.
