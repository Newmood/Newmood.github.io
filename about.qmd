I am an undergrad student with a keen interest in machine learning, data science, econometrics and quantitative finance.  I like to learn new things, seeking knowledge in domains besides tech as well whenever time and circumstances allow me. In leisure, I like to spend time with my wonderful family and friends. I also enjoy teaching and sharing my newfound knowledge by writing handouts.
